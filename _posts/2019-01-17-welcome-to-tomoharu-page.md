Hi there. Before telling myself, I would share my motto. It's "Always be thankful". When I lived in Osaka, it was 2020, COVID-19 has occurred. Everyone reminded how precious our lives are, how happy the time we can spend with families/friends is. The time the situation has got really serious with COVID-19, I realize I don't know how many times I can see with my parents, my sister, my friends...it'll be less than 100 times. Yeah it was too late to notice, but one thing I know is I still have chance to see them. I've got lots of their help. I cannot thank them enough. I decided when I see them, it's definitely the time to tell thank you. Moreover, not only them but also all of people who I will meet in the future... Through this thought, I gradually could set my motto here "Always be thankful". Yeah, thank you for reading this super long introduction.
